ðŸ“¦ Product Analysis Using EDA

This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on product data extracted from an Excel file (product.xlsx). The analysis aims to uncover key insights about product categories, pricing trends, customer ratings, and seller engagement using Python-based data science tools. The dataset includes fields such as Product_ID, Category, Price, Product_Rating, and Average_Rating_of_Similar_Products.
The analysis is organized into multiple numbered objectives, each representing a distinct analytical task. These include identifying the most common product categories, examining product rating distributions via histograms and boxplots, and evaluating the correlation between price, product rating, and similar product ratings. Additionally, pricing patterns are investigated using scatter plots and category-wise average line charts, enabling the identification of cost variation across different product categories.
